/Hello, this may be a bit odd considering the project but hear me out
/I Wanted the code to be compact and storing each question as a object will make it very bloated and hard to work with
/Plus, even though the example shown had 5 questions, I wanted to go the extra mile and make it extendable for more variety
/Even though this was not taught I wanted to learn how to get info from a file as it seems like helpful knowlege
/I am also writeing this file in a way so that questions can have more than one answer and have more or less that 4 options
/Anyway the format for how my code will read the file is below:
/ # = question, * = wrong answer, @ = correct answer, / = comments

#What is HTML an acronym for
*Heavy Turing Markup Language
*Higher Text Machine Language
@HyperText Markup Language
*Nothing, it just the initals of the 2 guys who created it
